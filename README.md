# About

Composer is a simple shell script to easily run [Rails Composer][rails_composer] from terminal without the need to remember uris or specific command parameters.First, add Composer's bin folder to your PATH variable:

Then run the command below from anywhere:

	~ compose APP_NAME

And you're done. Happy hacking!
